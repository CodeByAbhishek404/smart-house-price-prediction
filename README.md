## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to analyze housing data and build a regression model to predict house prices based on multiple features. It includes:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Feature selection and transformation  
- Machine Learning models for prediction  
- Summary statistics and insights

📚 Key Insights
RM (average number of rooms) has a strong positive correlation with house prices.

High LSTAT (lower status of the population) leads to lower prices.

Random Forest performs better than simple Linear Regression on this dataset.

🔗 Dataset Source
The dataset is based on the classic Boston Housing dataset (available via sklearn).
